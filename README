Poor man's surround sound, using the webcam!

Tracks the x coordinate of the user's shirt,
and in real-time uses that to set the left-right audio balance.

Mac OS X only for now.

Dependency:
    "SimpleCV"
    simplecv.org
    sudo pip install SimpleCV

Usage:
    ./audio_immerse.py
    Calibrates the shirt color to be the color of the pixel that is
    horizontally centered and vertically 3/4 of the way down.
    If not working, just run again; the calibration got unlucky.
    If you want less sensitivity, reduce the constant MOAR.
